# Programming-in-Python

My python programming practice and hands-on:

I am going to add code related to data structures, sorting, algorithms, coding challenges, competitive coding etc. 

## Data Structures
- Most of them are from undergrad data structures & a few other subjects
1. Tower OF Hanoi
2. Bully Election Algorithm
3. A * Algorithm
4. Greedy Best First Search
5. Vernam Cipher
6. RSA Algorithm
7. Winner Take it all
8. Encapsulation & Decapsulation

## Competitive Coding
- CodeChef, CodeSignal & HackerRank
1. Max Range Queries - https://repl.it/@MeetSanghvi/Max-Range-Queries-or-CodeChef
2. Chef & Secret Password - https://www.codechef.com/problems/SECPASS
3. Palindrome Check 
4. Lucky Ticket Number
5. Launch Sequence Checker - https://github.com/arsho/interview-practice/blob/master/codefights/BotChallenges/SpaceBot/launchSequenceChecker/readme.md
6. How Many Sundays
7. Matrix element sum
8. Monotonic Read Write
9. Launch Sequence Checker
10. Password Checker

Thank You!
